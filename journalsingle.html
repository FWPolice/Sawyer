                    <p>Over the past few months we have worked hard on a new Gravit frontend that is intuitive and attractive. After conducting countless hours of research, data analysis and conversations with our users, we finally have that ideal frontend.</p>
                    <p>The concept of Gravit was revolutionary. It replaced the needs of wasting time, effort, and money by creating an all inclusive platform. For starters, the Gravit Designer brought essential features that have never been explored or presented correctly on the web before. The ability to quickly design social media content, preset canvas, non-destructive compound shapes and more, were rarely found on the web. Now they are the most frequently used features in Gravit. The front-end brought the much desired community and collaboration feel that no design app nor platform has done before.</p>
                    <h3>Introducing the Workspace</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/journal/image1.jpg" alt="" />
                        <figcaption>The new Workspace Brings new opportunities</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In the past, designers depended on emails, collaboration tools, design communities and inspiration websites to complete their work. To create an all inclusive platform, the team at Gravit decided to bring all of these separate tools into one location where you can design, share, collaborate and get inspired. However, this was no easy task. To achieve this, Gravit required a interface that is not only easy to use but also attractive and had the feel of a native app. Before we started creating the new UI we first went ahead and defined characteristics of a native app. Two top qualities we found were: a native app has a UI and UX that feels more natural to the operating system and had great performance and interaction within the app.</p>
                    <p>Our biggest obstacle was the UI/UX. Gravit is a browser-based tool. It's difficult to make such tools look and feel great on all operating system without having a different UI for each. We tried several different variations in the past but found that they all felt more like a web-admin portal than a native interface. We needed to think outside of the box and go beyond the dashboard.</p>
                    <p>As any good team would do, we downloaded a number of native apps on OSX, Ubuntu, ChromeOS and Windows and observed pros and cons of the variety of apps on each systems. We found that the combination of Metro UI presented in Windows and Material UI in ChromeOS led to a great interface that worked for almost all platform. To go further, the flexibility of OSX and Ubuntu took the UX to the next level by presenting a crisp and intuitive feel to the overall platform. Combining these UI and UX concepts, we were able to take Gravit beyond the dashboard and into the era of the Workspace.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/journal/image2.jpg" alt="" />
                        <figcaption>The new Workspace Brings new opportunities</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The Gravit Workspace is easy to use. You have a single, consistent, side panel with your most important content. Exactly what our users has been asking for. Access to your personal files, your organization's files and settings are now accessible from a single location and on every page within the front-end. Click on the link on top left containing your username and you are presented with a popover with quick access to your settings and organizations. The selection you make from this dropdown will display either you or your organization’s workspace and will affect options including settings, notifications, files and searches.</p>
                    <p>Design settings and options have also been improved. There are several actions in Gravit that are selection based. To make it easier on users, we kept all static functions on the left and right side of the options bar. The selection based actions (i.e. actions seen after selecting a folder or design) now appear in the middle of the options bar.</p>
                    <p>The ability to rename content has also been made simplified. When you hover over the folder or design name, you are now presented with a pencil icon that triggers a rename action. Write the new name and press enter to save. It’s as simple as that.</p>
                    <p>If you want to take advanced actions, you can right click on the item or select the item and choose “More” from the action bar. You can choose to share, change properties or the status of your design to let your team members or community know of the progress.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/journal/image3.jpg" alt="" />
                        <figcaption>The new Workspace Brings new opportunities</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>The 'Native' Performance</h3>
                    <p>We tackled the performance issue for the front-end by implementing a quick load feature that pre-loads most content in the background while you browse through the page. We have now taken this a step further by improving the response time and the way each option is presented. For starters, you no longer have to access the Designer to view the different preset canvas sizes available in Gravit. Quickly access these by pressing the “Create Design” button in your Workspace. Secondly, most of the content is now being pre-loaded in the background while you are carrying out other tasks. This has resulted in a cut down of loading times, without interfering with your work.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/journal/image4.jpeg" alt="" />
                        <figcaption>The new Workspace Brings new opportunities</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Another major change we implemented to improve the overall performance of the Gravit front-end was how organizations and teams function. In the past, when a design was created, the designs were owned by the individual designer and then shared with the team. Now, the organization is the owner and is treated as a separate entity with multiple users. Think of organizations as the company and the teams as the groups working on a particular project. Each project has different team members from the organization working on it. By treating organization as a separate entity and allowing designs to be owned by a team, you are now able to switch workspace between your own and the organizations as easy as switching between different accounts without having to log in or out.</p>
                    <p>Our goal with Gravit is to remove the need to send emails to share designs, upload work to external websites to get feedback and share files to work on team projects. To take it further, we want it to feel as a ‘native’ app would. We are constantly improving the code, the interface and the UX of our front-end based on the usage data and the amazing feedback we receive from our wonderful community. This new interface was created to take our revolutionary product even further by ridding the dashboard feel and introducing the ‘native’ workspace. We hope you love the hard work the Gravity team has put into it. As always, we openly accept feedback to our improve our product even more.</p>
